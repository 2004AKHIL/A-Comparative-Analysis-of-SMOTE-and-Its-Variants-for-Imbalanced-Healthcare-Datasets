# A-Comparative-Analysis-of-SMOTE-and-Its-Variants-for-Imbalanced-Healthcare-Datasets
My project tackles imbalanced datasets using SMOTE and its variants. By generating synthetic samples for the minority class, I improved model learning, tested multiple ML models, and compared performance to show how oversampling boosts fairness and accuracy.
